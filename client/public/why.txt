I’ve never really been a big fan of social media. After a hard falling out last year, I decided to take some time off of the platforms. Admittedly, I didn’t have the easiest time making friends with the kids at my new school. Nonetheless, I still had a strong community of friends to lean — friends who genuinely cared about me — and I never felt as though I was missing out on too much by not being on them. It’s safe to say that I never truly needed it.

Still, I want to share the moments that make up my life from day-to-day with the people who care about me. This also acts as a means of self-expression: with the stereotypes we’ve associated with each social media platform — with Instagram being our highlight reels to Snapchat being a place for truly zany and wild clips — I’ve found it hard to just post a dumbass picture because it doesn’t fit the rule. Maybe this little project is contradictory to my goal of working past those boundaries. Either way, at least I got to practice the (M)ERN stack :)
